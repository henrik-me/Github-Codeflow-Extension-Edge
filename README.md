Github Codeflow Extension for Edge Chromium

## Info:
+ TLDR; clone the repo and enable developer extensions in Edge Chromium. Load the extension from where you cloned the bits to.

+ This is the first step of creating the plug-in. Additional work is required to get this shipped in the Microsoft Store for Trusted apps.
+ If not cloning copy the files in this repo to your local disk.
+ Follow the steps described above [Sideloading Extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading) to load the extension in developer mode.
+ Look for CodeFlow icon at end of PR titles that is link to open in CodeFlow. You may need to refresh existing pages for extension to connect.
